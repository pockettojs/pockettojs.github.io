- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), version 14 or above is recommended.
- [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). In order to build native modules of npm modules: leveldown, sqlite3, etc.
- [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)

### Platform Installation

Depending on your project platform, you can pick one of the following installation methods:

**Frontend**

1. Install python 3.8 or above
2. Install the `distutils` package by running the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install setuptools
```

3. Install node-gyp globally by running the following command:

npm install -g node-gyp
```

You can now proceed with the installation of Pocketto in your project.
